        "This is an implementation in Python for the well known **N-Queen** problem. The goal of the N-queens problem is to place N queens on a chessboard such that no queen attacks any other [**A queen attacks any piece in the same row, column or diagonal**]. \n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main kinds of formulation to solve this problem shown below, but in either case, the path cost is of no interest because only the final state counts.\n",
        "1. **An incremental formulation** involves operators that augment the state description, starting with an empty state; for the 8-queens problem, this means that each action adds a queen to the state. \n",
        "2. **A complete-state formulation** starts with all 8 queens on the board and moves them around. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first incremental formulation one might try is the following:\n",
        "* **States**: Any arrangement of 0 to 8 queens on the board is a state.\n",
        "* **Initial state**: No queens on the board.\n",
        "* **Actions**: Add a queen to any empty square.\n",
        "* **Transition model**: Returns the board with a queen added to the specified square. \n",
        "* **Goal test**: 8 queens are on the board, none attacked.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this formulation, we have $64 · 63 · · · 57 ≈ 1.8 × 10^{14}$ possible sequences to investigate. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A better formulation would **prohibit placing a queen in any square that is already attacked**:\n",
        "* **States**: All possible arrangements of n queens (0 ≤ n ≤ 8), one per column in the leftmost n columns, with no queen attacking another.\n",
        "* **Actions**: Add a queen to any square in the leftmost empty column such that it is not attacked by any other queen.\n",
        "\n",
        "This formulation reduces the 8-queens state space from $1.8 × 10^{14}$ to just $2,057$, and solutions are easy to find. On the other hand, for 100 queens the reduction is from roughly $10,400$ states to about $1052$ states — a big improvement, but not enough to make the problem tractable!\n",
